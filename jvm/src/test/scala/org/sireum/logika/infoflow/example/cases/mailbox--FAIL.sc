// Note:
//  For John to check:
//   Is there still a gap in the verification above:  Intuitively, we desire the flows to be
//   conditioned on the values of the ready flags in the pre-state.  We don't want to allow
//   those flags to be modified before the condition is checked to enable the flows.
